Tracking the experiments
------------------------

The experiment tracking is performed automatically for all experiments
executed using deep_nilmtk. Nevertheless, the generated artifacts are not automatically
linked in the experiments. It is done only if the user explicitely specifies it using
the corresponding parameter.

The artifacts here mean the results of the predictions as generated by nilmtk API. These predictions are saved
as a pickle file in all cases but only indexed in mlflow upon request.

                }),
