Hyper-parameters optimisation
-----------------------------

The hyper-parameter optimization is performed using Optuna. It can be done in
two steps as follows:

1. Declare the set of parameter to be optimized inside the model through
the definition of a static function return a dictionnary of values. The following Listing
provide an example of such function suggesting parameters for the window size,
the normlisation type, as well as the :

.. code-block:: python

    # Model Definition
    class NILM_MODEL(nn.Module):
        ...
        @staticmethod
        def suggest_hparams(self, trial):
            # Returns a dictionary of suggested values for each parameter
            window_length = trial.suggest_int('in_size', low=99, high=560)
            window_length += 1 if window_length % 2 == 0 else 0
            return {
                'in_size': window_length,
                'outsize':1
            }

2. Explicitly indicate to the toolkit that it should conduct a hyper-parameters search with Optuna

.. code-block:: python

    #Experiment Definition
    'model': NILMExperiment({
                # ... other params go here
                'model_class': NILM_MODEL,
                'use_optuna':True
            })

The use of optuna will generate several models and they will all have
saved as checkpoints in the corresponding folder splot into different sub-folders
labelled according to the trial ID.
