Cross-Validation
----------------

Cross validation is performed using sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit which is
a suitable splitting strategy for timeseries. The use of cross-validation is triggered
whenever a number of folds >= 1 is specified.

Other paramaters of sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit can also be specified
using same labels as the original function.
