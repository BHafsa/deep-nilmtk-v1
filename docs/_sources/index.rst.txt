Deep-NILMtk is an open source package designed specifically for deep models applied to solve NILM.
It is compatible with both PyTorch and TF. The training and testing pipelines
are fully compatible with NILMtk. Several deep learning tools are included that aim to support the
evaluation and the validation of those models (e.g., cross-validation, hyper-params optimization)
case of NILM.
