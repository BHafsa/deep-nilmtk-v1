New model
---------

The creation of a new model is straight forward and requires only the definition  of the architecture of the model
as well as the data loader. The tool takes into consideration the three input mapping types: Seq2point, Seq2Seq,
and Seq2subsequence.

A template project on Github illustrating how a new model can be tested is provided `here`_.
