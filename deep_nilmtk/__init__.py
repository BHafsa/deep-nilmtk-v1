"""
Deep-NILMtk is an open source package designed specifically for deep models applied to solve NILM. 
It is based on PyTorch & PyTorch-lightning for more flexibility. The training and testing pipelines 
are fully compatible with NILMtk. Several deep learning tools are included that aim to support the
evaluation and the validation of those models (e.g., cross-validation, hyper-params optimization) 
case of NILM.
